## Info:
- The source code for the program can be found in the `./src` folder.
- The project write up can be found in the `./doc` folder, along with the pictures referenced in the write up.
  - There are two versions of the write up; one is the (original) Markdown (`.md`) version, and the other the version converted to `.docx`. They each contain the same information, just in different file formats.
